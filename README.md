A tribute to the original game by TAITO. Written in Java.

The code is a bit messy because I had to rush for accademic reasons.
I'm currently reworking the whole project to make it cleaner and lighter!

Feel free too try it out on your ide.

UML is provided.

You can also find a project explanation in Italian, i will translate it soon!
